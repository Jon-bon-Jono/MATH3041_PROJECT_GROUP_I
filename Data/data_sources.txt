For each of the sources we need to know:
> Exactly what the data is measuring
> How the data was used in our model
> How the data was gathered/measured/estimated
> How accurate/reputable the data is

>> contents: The second solumn is the annual deviation from the preindustrial (1850) temperature of 14 degrees celcius (could you also find a reference for this value). 
>>Use: In the code I added 14 to all of these values to get the annual temperature, this was used to compare to the simulated temperature and validate the model

>> contents: Annual concentration of CO2 (ppm) [column "CO2spl"], CH4 (ppb) [column "CH4spl"] and N2O (ppb) [column "N2Ospl"] for years 1-2004
>> Use: used to calculate the radiative forcing for each of the greenhouse gasses in the model.

>> contents: median anual temperature in degrees cels (1850-2019) Global/Hemisphere/Tropics
   (the csv header says that this is the median, although the website says that is the average?)
