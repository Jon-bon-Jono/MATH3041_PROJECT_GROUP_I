    This takes in a list of CO2 levels for each year over a decedal period of time. 
    This data is then put into the chosen mathematical model to produce a list of 
    tuples that contains the expected temperature for a given year given is CO2 levels.

    Arguments:
        carbon_data (list of tuples(?))             - Contains the CO2 levels for each year in the
                                                      given decedal period
